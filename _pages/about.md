I am a postdoc in the [SPRING Lab](https://spring.epfl.ch/) at EPFL, headed by Prof. Carmela Troncoso. My position is funded by the [CYD Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/research/funding/epfl-programmes/cyd/cyd-postdoc/) of the Cyber-Defense Campus, where my main collaborator is Dr. Raphael Meier.

I completed my PhD in the [Computational Privacy Group](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/index.html) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), advised by [Dr. Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye](http://www.demontjoye.com/index.html). My research lies at the intersection between machine learning, privacy, and security. I study privacy and security vulnerabilities in data processing technologies: machine learning models, query-based systems, and perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning, through the lens of automated attacks. Through a rigorous study of privacy vulnerabilities, my research can inform the design of principled countermeasures allowing to prevent them and, ultimately, to use data safely.

26/02/2024: My paper "Re-pseudonymization strategies in smart meter data are not robust to deep learning profiling attacks" with Miruna Rusu and Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye has been accepted at CODASPY 2024. The paper will be out soon.

01/02/2024: My paper [Investigating the Effect of Misalignment on Membership Privacy in the White-box Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05093) with Daniel Jones, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, and Shruti Tople has been accepted at PoPETS 2024!

22/01/2024: I attended the discussion panel of the [Synthetic Data for Biomedical Applications](https://www.datascience.ch/event/synthetic-data-for-biomedical-applications) workshop organised by CHUV and the Swiss Data Science Center.
