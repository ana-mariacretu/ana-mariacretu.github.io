I am a fourth year PhD candidate in the [Computational Privacy Group](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/index.html) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), advised by [Dr. Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye](http://www.demontjoye.com/index.html). My research interests lie at the intersection between (1) machine learning and (2) privacy and security. I study vulnerabilities in behavioral datasets and data processing systems such as machine learning models, query-based systems and client-side scanning through the lens of automated attacks. Specifically, I use machine learning and evolutionary algorithms to develop novel attacks against such systems. The impact of my work is to increase awareness about existing privacy vulnerabilities in data processing systems. I firmly believe that the understanding of privacy vulnerabilities informs the design of principled countermeasures allowing to prevent them and, ultimately, to use data safely.

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science from EPFL, Switzerland, a Master’s degree in Data Science and a Bachelor in Engineering (Diplome d'Ingénieur) from Ecole Polytechnique (France), the last with a focus on Pure and Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I did my Master Thesis in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Lukasiewicz, and in close collaboration with Dr. Oana-Maria Camburu. My research there was on 1) developing deep learning-based approaches to solve the Winograd Schema Challenge and 2) developing sentence representation models with the goal of improving interpretability and performance on a set of benchmark natural language processing tasks.

In the summer of 2020, I was a research intern at Twitter (London, UK) in the graph learning team. I worked with Dr. Davide Eynard on the privacy of Twitter graph data. In 2017, I did a summer internship at Google (Boulder, Colorado, USA), in the Payments Compliance Engineering Team, where I was supervised by Craig Wright. In 2016, I did a 5-month internship at Google (Paris, France), where I was supervised by Dr. Sertan Girgin.
