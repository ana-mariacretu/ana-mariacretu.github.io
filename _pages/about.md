I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the [Computational Privacy Group](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/index.html) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). My research studies privacy vulnerabilities in behavioral datasets and data processing systems such as: machine learning models, query-based systems and client-side scanning through the lens of automated adversarial attacks. More specifically, I use machine learning and evolutionary algorithms to develop novel attacks against such systems. The impact of my work is to increase awareness about existing privacy vulnerabilities in systems data processing systems. I firmly believe that the understanding of privacy vulnerabilities informs the design of principled countermeasures to prevent them and ultimately to allow the safe use of data.

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science from EPFL, Switzerland, a Master’s degree in Data Science and a Bachelor in Engineering (Diplome d'Ingenieur) from Ecole Polytechnique (France), the last with a focus on Pure and Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I did my Master Thesis in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Lukasiewicz, and in close collaboration with Dr. Oana-Maria Camburu. My research there was on 1) solving the Winograd Schema Challenge and 2) on developing sentence representation models with the goal of improving interpretability and performance on a set of benchmark natural language processing tasks.

In the summer of 2020, I was a research intern at Twitter (London, UK) in the graph learning team. I worked with Dr. Davide Eynard on the privacy of Twitter graph data. In 2017, I did a summer internship at Google (Boulder, Colorado, USA), in the Payments Compliance Engineering Team, under Craig Wright’s supervision. In 2016, I did a 5-month internship at Google (Paris, France), under Dr. Sertan Girgin’s supervision.
