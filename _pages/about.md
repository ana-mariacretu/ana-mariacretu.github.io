I am a postdoc jointly at EPFL's [SPRING Lab](https://spring.epfl.ch/), headed by Prof. Carmela Troncoso, and the Cyber-Defense (CYD) Campus in Lausanne, Switzerland. I am generously funded by the [CYD Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/research/funding/epfl-programmes/cyd/cyd-postdoc/) of the CYD Campus where my main collaborator is Dr. Raphael Meier.


I completed my PhD in the [Computational Privacy Group](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/index.html) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), advised by [Dr. Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye](http://www.demontjoye.com/index.html). My research lies at the intersection between machine learning, privacy, and security. I study privacy and security vulnerabilities in data processing technologies: machine learning models, query-based systems, and perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning, through the lens of automated attacks. Through a rigorous study of privacy vulnerabilities, my research can inform the design of principled countermeasures allowing to prevent them and, ultimately, to use data safely.

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science from [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and the _Diplome d'Ingénieur de l'Ecole Polytechnique_ (equivalent to a Bachelors and Master’s degree) from [Ecole Polytechnique, France](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en). At Ecole Polytechnique, I studied Pure and Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, and specialized in Data Science. Towards completion of my EPFL MSc degree, I did my Master Thesis in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Thomas Lukasiewicz](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/thomas.lukasiewicz/), and in close collaboration with [Dr. Oana-Maria Camburu](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/oana-maria.camburu/). My research there was on 1) developing deep learning-based approaches to solve the Winograd Schema Challenge and on 2) developing sentence representation models with the goal of improving interpretability and performance on a set of benchmark natural language processing tasks.

In the summer of 2022, I was a research intern in the Microsoft Research Confidential Computing team (Cambridge, UK). I worked on the privacy of machine learning models with Shruti Tople and Daniel Jones. In the summer of 2020, I was a research intern at Twitter (London, UK) in the graph learning team. I worked with Dr. Davide Eynard on the privacy of Twitter graph data. In 2017, I did a summer internship at Google (Boulder, Colorado, USA), in the Payments Compliance Engineering Team, where I was supervised by Craig Wright. In 2016, I did a 5-month internship at Google (Paris, France), where I was supervised by Dr. Sertan Girgin.
