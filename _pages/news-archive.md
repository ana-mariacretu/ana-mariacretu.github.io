# 2023

01/11/2023: I started a postdoc at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. I am part of the [SPRING Lab](https://spring.epfl.ch/) headed by Prof. Carmela Troncoso. I am generously funded by the [CYD Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/research/funding/epfl-programmes/cyd/cyd-postdoc/) of the Swiss Cyberdefense Campus where my main collaborator is Dr. Raphael Meier.

24/07/2023: This week I visited Prof. Thorsten Strufe and his research group at KIT, spending a wonderful week in Karlsruhe.

11/07/2023: I participated in a panel on Data Protection in an AI-Driven World organised by the UK Internet Governance Forum, talking about how we can evaluate the privacy risks of AI models.

04/07/2023: New preprint available: [Synthetic is all you need: removing the auxiliary data assumption for membership inference attacks against synthetic data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01701).

30/06/2023: This week I attended the Interdisciplinary Summerschool on Privacy (<a href="https://isp.cs.ru.nl/2023/index.php">ISP 2023</a>) in Berg en Dal, Netherlands. I taught a 2-hour class titled "Evaluating the privacy of data processing systems through inference attacks".

17/06/2023: New preprint available: [Achilles' Heels: Vulnerable Record Identification in Synthetic Data Publishing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10308).

14/06/2023: I presented my [Re-aligning Shadow Models can Improve White-box Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05093.pdf) paper at the PPML workshop in Paris.

14/06/2023: I presented the QuerySnout tool and attended a panel on re-identification at the [CNIL Privacy Research Day](https://www.cnil.fr/en/call-papers-privacy-research-day-2023) event in Paris. Three of my other papers were presented by my collaborators on the other panels, two of which examine the robustness of perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning and a third one demonstrating correlation leakages in ML models.

08/06/2023: New preprint available: [Re-aligning Shadow Models can Improve White-box Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05093.pdf).

12/05/2023: I successfully defended my PhD thesis! I am grateful to my examiners Prof. Vitaly Shmatikov and Prof. Emil Lupu for their feedback.

10/05/2023: I gave a talk about my research at the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.

26/04/2023: I gave a talk about my research at the Computer Science Brunel PhD Symposium.

03/04/2023: Our paper <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2023/933600a234/1NrbXDL6b2U"> Deep perceptual hashing algorithms with hidden dual-purpose: when client-side scanning does facial recognition </a> has been accepted at the IEEE S&P 2023 conference!

20/02/2023: I presented my work at the probability and statistics seminar of the University of Bourgogne France-Comte (Besancon).

# 2022

09/11/2022: This week, I attended the ACM CCS 2022 conference in Los Angeles, USA. I presented my paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3560581">QuerySnout: Automating the Discovery of Attribute Inference Attacks against Query-Based Systems</a>.
